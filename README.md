# Customized Meal Recommendation System

This project is a **Customized Meal Recommendation System** built in Python. It uses user preferences and nutritional requirements to generate meal suggestions tailored to the individual's dietary needs and lifestyle.

## 🌟 Features

- Personalized meal suggestions based on calorie and nutrient requirements.
- User input for dietary preferences and restrictions.
- Nutritional calculations (e.g., calories, proteins, fats, carbohydrates).
- Simple command-line interface for interaction.
- Modular and easily extendable codebase.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy

> No external API or GUI is used – this is a CLI-based prototype focusing on logic and functionality.

_Add CLI screenshots here if needed._

## 🙋‍♀️ How It Works

1. User inputs age, weight, height, dietary preferences, etc.
2. System computes the BMR and daily nutritional needs.
3. Matches meals based on calorie/nutrient compatibility.
4. Outputs a list of recommended meals.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integration with a food API (e.g., Edamam, Spoonacular).
- GUI (Tkinter/Web-based) interface.
- Database of meals with images and recipes.
- Mobile app version.
